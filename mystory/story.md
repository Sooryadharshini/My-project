Once upon a time there lived a man who had four sons. Being a father he was a very hardworking person. He owned large feilds and he worked very hard on them. But whereas his sons were lazy and persistent to do any work. They did not want to work hard but only reap benefits.

The father suddenly fell ill and was insisting his sons to take over his farm and work on it, but the children were lazy and did not want to go. 

One fine day the father had called his sons and told them about the treasure e has hid in his farms. 

After the father has told his sons about the teasure he fell il and passed away. His sons immediately went to the feilds to find the teasure. However, after long hours of searching they did not find any teasure. So they went back and realized that it was time for sowing cotton. After 3 months they earned good yeild from the feilds and sold it for lump sum money. And finally they understood the teasure left behiund by their father.
